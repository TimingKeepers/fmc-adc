\section{Calibration}

The calibration is done once during the prodoction tests.
It can be repeated afterwards with the production test suite (PTS) and the corresponding testbench.
The calibration process gives four values per channel and per input range:
ADC gain correction, ADC offset correction, DAC gain correction and DAC offset correction.
The temperature during the calibration process is also measured.
All the calibration values are stored in the FmcAdc100m14b4cha EEPROM.
Tables \ref{tab:adc_calibr_data_eeprom} and \ref{tab:dac_calibr_data_eeprom} shows the calibration data types and the arrangement in the EEPROM.
Note that ADC calibration data are stored before DAC calibration data in the EEPROM.

  \label{tab:dac_calibr_data_eeprom}
\end{table}

Two registers per channel are implemented in the FPGA for ADC gain and offset correction.
When an input range is selected, the corresponding gain/offset correction values must be loaded from the EEPROM to those registers.

As the DAC value is set once before an acquisition, there is no need to implement the gain and offset correction in the FPGA.
Therefore gain and offset correction must be applied to the DAC value by the software.

Below is the pseudo-code to calculate the DAC corrected value, applying gain and offset correction:
\begin{verbatim}
c_val = ((((val-0x8000+offset) << 15) * gain) >> 30)+0x8000
\end{verbatim}
