\section{Introduction}
This document gives information needed by HDL and driver/library developers to support the FMCADC100M14b4cha FPGA Mezzanine Cards\footnote{See \href{http://www.ohwr.org/projects/fmc-adc-100m14b4cha}{http://www.ohwr.org/projects/fmc-adc-100m14b4cha}.} in the PCIe FMC carrier\footnote{See \href{http://www.ohwr.org/projects/fmc-pci-carrier}{http://www.ohwr.org/projects/fmc-pci-carrier}.} designed by BE-CO-HT at CERN. The support for this module must be as generic as possible in order to benefit from this effort for other ADC FMC cards and carriers. In particular, the sample width, number of channels and sampling rate should all be configurable parameters in the design. Another important aspect is to preserve insofar as possible the re-usability of developments between PCIe and VME64x uses, knowing that the VME64x carrier can host two mezzanines whereas the PCIe carrier has only one FMC site.

This design will jump over the functional specification phase to gain some time. This document should be read as a functional and technical specification in one. Users are of course welcome to challenge both functional and technical aspects before approval.

The PCIe carrier board has a Spartan 6 XC6SLX150T FPGA at its heart, surrounded by a host of peripherals for different applications. In particular, there is a fair amount of SRAM, DDR3 RAM, a PLL chip, a DDS and Flash ROM. The FPGA is connected to a VITA 57 FPGA Mezzanine Card (FMC) slot, covering all pins of the Low Pin Count (LPC) connector. The purpose of this document is to specify how this carrier and the FMCADC100M14b4cha 4-channel 100 MS/s ADC mezzanine card can be used to build a complete ADC solution through appropriate configuration of the FPGA in the carrier. An important aspect to bear in mind is that this proposal takes the fastest path to get a fully working system to cover immediate needs in the accelerators, while trying to preserve the investments made in HDL development. The design will no doubt evolve in the future, once the short term needs are covered.

The proposed internal structure of the FPGA design can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:block_diagram}. It consists of a set of Wishbone cores, namely one Wishbone master and a set of slaves. Each slave deals with one or more external peripherals, with the exception of the interrupt controller. The PLL, DDS and SRAM chips are not used in this design. In the following sections, we go through all blocks, specifying their function and their internal registers.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{block_diagram.pdf}
  \caption{FPGA design internal structure.}
  \label{fig:block_diagram}
\end{figure}

\section{FPGA blocks}
For each internal block, we give a summary description of its function along with internal registers which can be read of written from the Wishbone master. Registers are presented in tables with their name, address offset (in 32-bit long words), access mode, value after reset and description. The address offset is the offset of a given register with respect to the beginning of the memory area pointed to by a given PCIe Base Address Register (BAR). This design only supports full 32-bit reads and writes. Even if some of the registers described below use different bits for different things, that does not mean they can be written to independently from the rest of the word, so care should be taken in each write to affect all bits in an appropriate way. In general, unused bits should be ignored on read and written to with a '0'. For status registers, bits read as '0' represent a normal state of affairs, while those set to '1' signal some departure from nominal operation.

\subsection{GN4124 to Wishbone bridge}
This block is a slave of the external GN4124 local bus and a master of the internal Wishbone bus. The GN4124 from Gennum is a PCIe to local bus bridge, capable of using 4 PCIe lanes for fast communication with the host and with DMA capability as well. In addition, the GN4124 can be used to reprogram the on-board FPGA. 

PCIe bursts will be converted in this block to Wishbone bursts. A one-tick-long positive pulse from the interrupt controller will trigger generation of a message-based PCIe interrupt.

\subsection{Board control and status}
This block contains all control and status registers related to the carrier board independently of the application. Table~\ref{tab:stat_control} shows the list of registers in this block.

  \end{tabularx}
  \caption{Register set for the board control and status block.}
  \label{tab:stat_control}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{CARRTYPER}
The CARRTYPER register uses bits [31..16] for a carrier type identifier and bits [7..0] for the PCB version, signaled to the FPGA through optional pull-up resistors in the PCB. 

\subsubsection{SIIDLR and SIIDHR}
The SIIDLR and SIIDHR registers contain respectively the low and high parts of the 64-bit Silicon ID read from the Maxim DS18B20 1-Wire digital thermometer after system reset. 

\subsubsection{BSTREAMTR and BSTREAMDR}
BSTREAMTR uses bits [31..16] for defining an FPGA bit stream type and [15..0] for a sequential number indicating the bit stream version. BSTREAMDR contains the 32-bit UTC time when the bit stream was generated. 

\subsubsection{CARRTEMPR}
CARRTEMPR contains the carrier temperature as read from the DS18B20 every second. The Board control and status block will set a bit to '1' for one clock tick after every reading if the temperature exceeds 60$^\circ$ Celsius. This bit will be connected to the interrupt controller so that the user can get a temperature interrupt if enabled. 

\subsubsection{STATUSR}
STATUSR contains the carrier status, and in particular the status of power supplies and the detection of presence of a card in the FMC slot. Power supplies in the carrier are extensively monitored, and most of them provide a Power Good (G) signal. The internal structure of the STATUSR register is as follows:
\begin{packed_item}
\item Bits [31..11] are unused.
\item Bits [10..0] are (starting from bit 10): FMC\_PRESENT, $\overline{3V3\_FMC\_G}$,  $\overline{VADJ\_G}$, $\overline{1V8\_G}$,  $\overline{1V5\_G}$,  $\overline{CLEAN\_1V8\_G}$, $\overline{CLEAN\_3V3\_G}$, $\overline{5V\_G}$, \linebreak$\overline{M2V\_G}$, $\overline{M5V2\_G}$ and $\overline{M12V\_G}$.
\end{packed_item}

\subsubsection{SUPCTRLR}
The carrier has several power supplies that can be enabled or disabled individually from the FPGA. They are controlled from the SUPCTRLR register, which is a bit field made of individual Enable (E) bits. In addition, some bits in this register are used to select which power supply voltage and current are monitored through the SUPAQNR register.
\begin{packed_item}
\item Bits [31..16] are unused.
\item Bits [15..12] are unused.
\item Bits [11..8] contain an unsigned 4-bit number which selects a power supply for voltage and current monitoring. Starting at 0: 3V3\_PCIe, 12V\_PCIe, 3V3\_FMC, VADJ, 1V8, 1V5, VTTDDR, 1V2\_CORE, 1V2\_GTP,\linebreak CLEAN\_1V8, CLEAN\_3V3, 5V, M2V, M5V2 and M12V.
\item Bits [7..4] are unused.
\item Bits [3..0] are (starting from bit 3): VADJ\_E, M2V\_E, M5V2\_E, M12V\_E.
\end{packed_item}

\subsubsection{SUPAQNR}
The SUPAQNR register holds a voltage and current consumption value resulting from on-board measurements using 16-bit ADCs. The selection of power supply to monitor is done in SUPCTRLR. Bits [31..16] hold an unsigned word representing voltage, while bits [15..0] are used for current consumption. To get Volts and Amperes from the raw measurements, different conversion factors must be used for each supply, as described in table~\ref{tab:conv_fact}.

\begin{table}[htbp]
  \centering
  \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|X|l|l|}
    \hline
    \textbf{SUPPLY} & \textbf{Voltage factor (V/count)} & \textbf{Current factor (A/count)} \\

    M12V & & \\
    \hline
  \end{tabularx}
  \caption{Conversion factors for voltage and current consumption measurements.}
  \label{tab:conv_fact}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{CONTROLR}
CONTROLR will allow control operations on the carrier, such as setting the Vadj supply voltage for the FMC slot through bits [31..16] and setting the system clock frequency through bits [15..0]. Vadj will change from 1V (0x0000) to 3.5V (0xFFFF). The frequency control word will drive a 16-bit DAC connected to a VCXO with 25 MHz center frequency and a span of 10 ppm. It is anticipated that any fixed value will do for our application, and that an internal PLL multiplying this 25 MHz by 5 will generate a 125 MHz system clock which will guarantee an absence of FIFO overflows from the 100 MS/s ADC chip.

\subsection{Interrupt controller}
The interrupt controller receives interrupt requests from different blocks, combines them and sends an interrupt request to the GN4124/Wishbone bridge. For each interrupt input, it sets a bit in the IRQSRCR register upon synchronous detection of a rising edge. These bits are cleared on read. Care must be taken at design time to avoid race conditions in which a rising edge does not result in setting a bit because of the overriding effect of a concurrent read. Detection of a rising edge in any of the bits can result in the generation of an interrupt if the associated bit in the IRQENR register is set. The interrupt sent to the GN4124/Wishbone bridge is a one-tick-long positive pulse.

    \hline
    IRQENR & & R/W & & Interrupt enable mask\\
    \hline
  \end{tabularx}
  \caption{Register set for the interrupt controller block.}
  \label{tab:irq_control}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{IRQSRCR and IRQENR}
The IRQSRCR and IRQENR are both bit fields with the same internal structure. The upper bits (except bit 31 of IRQSRCR, see below) are reserved for future use. Bits [8..0] are: DMA completion, carrier over-heating, FMC over-heating, FMC input over-load, ADC trigger, ADC shot taken, FMC ID I2C R/W completion, FMC Si570 I2C R/W completion and FMC ADC configuration R/W completion. If an interrupt fires more than once before IRQSRCR is read, bit 31 of IRQSRCR will be set, for debugging purposes. This bit is also cleared on read.   

\subsection{Dual port DDR RAM controller}
This block handles access to the MT41J128M16HA-15E DDR3 RAM chip from Micron. This chip has a data width of 16 bits and can hold 32 MSamples per channel in our application. The fact that only one sample can be written at a time means that the RAM must work at least four times faster than the ADCs, and this should be no problem. To avoid mapping a large memory into the host address space unnecessarily, and to unload the host for reading, the core also implements a DMA engine. Another important aspect is to avoid collisions between Wishbone read requests and ADC write requests. Taking into account that continuous read applications are not typical for such high-speed sampling systems, we will just allow reading while the state machine of the ADC core (see figure~\ref{fig:state_machine}) is in the Idle state. An attempt to read while the ADC is in any other state will result in a bus error.

Memory will be organized internally as a circular buffer, with all 4 channels being logged in an interleaved way, starting with channel 1 at offset 0. After a shot, the host can read the address in DDR RAM of the sample corresponding to the trigger moment for channel 1 in the TRIGPOSR register of the ADC Controller block (see table~\ref{tab:adc_control}). All addresses are byte addresses, i.e. DDR RAM addresses get incremented by 2 for each sample, and one needs to jump by 8 byte locations to go from one sample to the next for the same channel, because of the interleaving. By convention, the complete sample buffer for an acquisition contains ADCPRER+ADCPOSTR samples, and the TRIGPOSR register points to the last sample in the ADCPRER part. 

The DMA engine works with a linked list so that DMAs can be chained. The first item in the list is loaded by the host on the carrier and contains a pointer to the next one, which is in host memory. The DMA engine will fetch items from host memory and perform the corresponding DMAs until one of the items is recognized as the last one though the contents of the DMAATTRIBR register (see table~\ref{tab:ddr_control}). Each item in the list is made of the following registers: DMACSTARTR, DMAHSTARTLR, DMAHSTARTHR, DMALENR, DMANEXTLR, DMANEXTHR and DMAATTRIBR. In addition, the DMA controller provides global DMA control and status registers. 

\begin{table}[htbp]

  \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l|r|l|l|X|}
    \hline
    \textbf{NAME} & \textbf{OFFSET} & \textbf{MODE} & \textbf{RESET} & \textbf{DESCRIPTION} \\
    \hline
    \hline
    DMACTRLR & & R/W & & DMA start address in the carrier\\
    \hline
    DMASTATR & & R/W & & DMA start address (low) in the host\\
    \hline
    DMACSTARTR & & R/W & & DMA start address in the carrier\\
    \hline
    DMAHSTARTLR & & R/W & & DMA start address (low) in the host\\
    \hline
    DMAHSTARTHR & & R/W & & DMA start address (high) in the host\\
    \hline
    DMALENR & & R/W & & DMA read length in bytes\\
    \hline
    DMANEXTLR & & R/W & & Pointer (low) to next item in list\\
    \hline
    DMANEXTHR & & R/W & & Pointer (high) to next item in list\\
    \hline
    DMAATTRIBR & & R/W & & DMA endianness and control\\
    \hline
  \end{tabularx}
  \caption{Register set for the DDR RAM controller block.}
  \label{tab:ddr_control}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{DMACTRLR}
Writing 1 to this register starts a DMA transfer. Writing 2 aborts the ongoing transfer.

\subsubsection{DMASTATR}
This is a status register for the DMA engine. Possible contents are:
\begin{packed_item}
\item 0: Idle (before any DMA transfer takes place).
\item 1: Done (after successful DMA).
\item 2: Busy.
\item 3: Error (following a memory access error, either on the host or on the carrier).
\item 4: Aborted (after receiving an abort command in DMACTRLR).
\end{packed_item}

\subsubsection{DMACSTARTR}
The DMACSTARTR register holds a byte address pointing to a location inside the DDR RAM, at which the DMA access should start. Taking into account that the DDR is a 16-bit device, only even values are allowed in DMACSTARTR.

\subsubsection{DMAHSTARTLR and DMAHSTARTHR}
Registers DMAHSTARTLR and DMAHSTARTHR select the low and high parts of the 64-bit start address for the DMA access in the host. 

\subsubsection{DMALENR}
Register DMALENR selects the length of the reading in bytes, i.e. twice the number of samples to be read by the host.

\subsubsection{DMANEXTLR and DMANEXTHR}
These two registers contain the low and high parts of the 64-bit address of the next item in the linked list, in host memory.

\subsubsection{DMAATTRIBR}
This register contains several control features for the DMA engine:
\begin{packed_item}
\item Bits [31..2] are reserved.
\item Bit 1 is set to '0' for little-endian accesses and '1' for big-endian. This affects the way in which 16-bit samples can be stored in a 32-bit long word.
\item Bit 0 is set to '1' to signal this is the last item in the linked list, '0' otherwise.
\end{packed_item}

The end of a DMA access generates an interrupt request towards the interrupt controller.

\subsection{ADC controller}
The ADC controller handles all communication with the ADC FMC. It has a Wishbone slave for configuration registers and a dedicated output connection to the DDR RAM controller for samples. It can also drive interrupt requests into the interrupt controller. These interrupts are all one-tick-long positive pulses. The sampling state machine is depicted in figure~\ref{fig:state_machine}. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{state_machine.pdf}
  \caption{Sampling process state machine.}
  \label{fig:state_machine}
\end{figure}

The state machine will drive two pulse-like signals into the IRQ controller. One will be a trigger interrupt and the other an end of shot interrupt, generated once the state machine reaches the Idle state after an acquisition. In addition, the ADC controller will produce interrupts in case of FMC over-heating and input over-load (to protect the optional 50 Ohm termination). All of these interrupts can be enabled/disabled in the interrupt controller block. The ADC controller is also in charge of controlling two LEDs: power good and trigger (100 ms width).

  \caption{Register set for the ADC controller block.}
  \label{tab:adc_control}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{ADCCTRLR}
The START, STOP, and SOFT\_TRIG commands can be used to provoke transitions in the state machine from the PCIe bus, by writing appropriate patterns (1, 2 and 3 respectively) into the least significant byte of the ADCCTRLR register. A STOP command will always take the state machine to the Idle state, regardless of what its current state is. A write of '1' to bit 31 of ADCCTRLR will reset the sample counter in ADCCNTR (see \ref{sssec:adccntr}).

\subsubsection{ADCSTATR}
The current state in the state machine can be read from the ADCSTATR register. Idle~=~0, Pre-trigger Count~=~1, Wait Trigger~=~2 and Wait End of Shot~=~3.

\subsubsection{TRIGCFGR}
The TRIGGER condition in figure \ref{fig:state_machine} is to be interpreted as an 'OR' of hardware and software (SOFT\_TRIG) triggers. Trigger configuration is handled through the TRIGCFGR register. Bits [31:16] are used for a threshold (treated as 2's complement and compared to the raw ADC data) in case of internal trigger, bit 0 selects between internal ('0') and external ('1') trigger and bit 1 selects positive ('0') or negative ('1') slope. Hardware and software triggers can be enabled using bits 2 and 3 respectively. A trigger applies to all 4 channels. Bits 4 and 5 in TRIGCFGR select a channel to use for the case of internal hardware trigger.  

\subsubsection{ADCxOFFSR and ADCxGAINR}
Controlling the offset and gain of each ADC we have the ADCxOFFSR and ADCxGAINR registers, where x ranges from 1 to 4. The ADCxOFFSR registers are used to load a 16-bit DAC in the mezzanine, so only bits [15..0] are used. ADCxGAINR are in fact bit field registers, with each bit controlling an independent switch. These switches are used in normal operation to set gains, but can also be used for disconnecting the input signal from the ADC for automatic calibration purposes. More information can be found in \href{http://www.ohwr.org/projects/fmc-adc-100m14b4cha}{http://www.ohwr.org/projects/fmc-adc-100m14b4cha}. For the purpose of this specification, it is enough to say that there are seven switches per analog input channel and they will be mapped to the least significant bits of the ADCxGAINR registers, starting with SW1 in bit 0 and ending with SW7 in bit 6.

\subsubsection{ADCIDADDR and ADCIDDATR}
The ADC FMC card has two I2C busses connected to it from the carrier FPGA through the FMC connector. The first one grants access to an FMC identification EEPROM on the mezzanine, which can be used to read/write the type of mezzanine, in agreement with the FMC standard. It is read and written using registers ADCIDADDR and ADCIDDATR. The FPGA puts the address plus a R/W flag into the ADCIDADDR register and then reads or writes from/to the ADCIDDATR. The location used for the read ('0') or write ('1') flag is bit 31. A read to ADCIDDATR must only be performed after the I2C controller has had time to get the data from the EEPROM. A write also has to be performed carefully, only after the previous write has succeeded. The I2C controller inside the ADC controller signals read and write completion through an interrupt request to the IRQ controller block. 

\subsubsection{ADCCLKADDR and ADCCLKDATR}
There is a separate I2C bus for controlling the Si570 clock generator in the mezzanine. Our application assumes it will be programmed to provide a constant 100 MHz frequency. Registers ADCCLKADDR and ADCCLKDATR are used in the same way as the EEPROM ones to read and write from/to the Si570 clock generator. 

\subsubsection{ADCADDR and ADCDATR}
The ADC chip itself can be controlled through an SPI bus granting read and write access to its internal configuration registers. SPI reads and writes use the same mechanism as the other two serial busses in the mezzanine. The ADCADDR register is used for addresses and the ADCDATR register holds the data.

\subsubsection{SRATER}
Effective sampling rate is obtained by dividing the nominal 100 MHz from the Si570 by a variable amount, i.e. the FPGA will get data constantly at 100MS/s and will decimate it before writing into RAM. The decimation factor will be stored in bits [15..0] of SRATER.

\subsubsection{ADCPRER and ADCPOSTR}
The number of samples to be acquired before and after the trigger are common to all channels and stored in the ADCPRER and ADCPOSTR registers respectively.

\subsubsection{ADCCNTR}
\label{sssec:adccntr}
For diagnostics and time-correlation purposes, the ADC controller hosts a 32-bit free-running counter which gets reset at power up and optionally following a command. This clearing uses bit 31 in the ADCCTRLR register, so it can be used in combination with any command. The value of the counter is incremented at the effective sampling rate, i.e. after decimation, and can be read in the ADCCNTR register.   

\subsubsection{ADCSHOTCNTR}
Another counter running at the sampling rate counts the number of samples for a given shot. It is reset on START, counts up to the number of pre-trigger samples, waits for a trigger and continues counting up to pre-trigger + post-trigger samples. Its value can be accessed in the ADCSHOTCNTR register.
